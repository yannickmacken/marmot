# marmot
Marmot is a plug-in for Grasshopper which allows the user to create and deconstruct graphs representing rooms, connections and areas, and can generate a plan layout from a graph. üè°

To generate a plan layout, the user is required to construct a graph, and set a rectangular boundary. Optionally, certain rooms can be fixed in place. 
The component applies an exhaustive search method and works best for plans with up to 6/7 rooms. The result is a floorplan that is optimized to meet all requirements. 

The plug-in can be downloaded for free on [food4Rhino](https://www.food4rhino.com/en/app/marmot).
